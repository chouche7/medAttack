# Understanding Adversarial Attacks on Deep Predictive Models for Electronic Medical Records
Based on the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04822). 

## Code Usage
- cw.py Algorithm for Generating Adversarial Examples
- cw_main.py Main functions
- Implementation was interagted from [EAD: Elastic-Net Attacks to Deep Neural Networks via Adversarial Examples](https://github.com/ysharma1126/EAD_Attack) and [Adversarial Algorithms in TensorFlow](https://zenodo.org/record/1154272#.W7TYc5NKhTY). 

TODO:
∗ Dependencies (which packages are required)
∗ Download instruction of data and pretrained
model (if applicable)
∗ Functionality of scripts: preprocessing, training,
evaluation, etc.
∗ Instruction to run the code
